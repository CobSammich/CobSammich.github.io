<h1>OMSCS Specializations</h1>
<p>Okay I thought I was pretty set on doing Machine Learning for my specialization, but I was looking
them over once again today and they honestly all sound interesting...</p>
<h2>Pros and Cons to each specialization</h2>
<h3>Computational Perception and Robotics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros:<ol>
<li>Artificial Intelligence is a core course</li>
<li>Computational Photography and Computer Vision are Electives</li>
<li>3D reconstruction is an elective</li>
<li>Multiview Geometry in Computer Vision Robotics is an elective</li>
<li>Only 15 hours of Core courses (as opposed to 18 for others)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cons:<ol>
<li>Other than Into to GA, none of the Core courses look overly interesting to me</li>
<li>Human-Robot Interaction(?) is an elective</li>
<li>Interactive Robot Learning(?) is an elective</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Overall thoughts: Some of the electives don't really interest me, but there are many
  Camera-view based courses that I would like to take</li>
</ul>
<h3>Computing Systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros:<ol>
<li>Advanced Operating Systems is a core course</li>
<li>High performance Computer architecture is a core course</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cons:<ol>
<li>18 hours for core and elective courses</li>
<li>This is more so heavy on networks, computing optimizations, and software design.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Overall Thoughts: Not big on the concepts you would learn in this compared to what I would learn
  in all 3 other specializations. I am interested in them, but less so than I am with algorithms,
  ML, and other things. <strong>Rank Computational Perception and Robotics higher than this</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interactive Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros:<ol>
<li>Artificial Intelligence is a core course</li>
<li>Machine Learning is a core course</li>
<li>15 hours for completion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cons:<ol>
<li>Human-Computer Interaction is an elective (Agile Development... lol)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Overall Thoughts: There is a lot of ethics involved in this specialization. Sounds like a lot of
  writing and not a lot of algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pros:<ol>
<li>Computer Vision is an elective</li>
<li>15 hours for completion</li>
<li>Deep learning is an elective</li>
<li>Machine Learning Theory is an elective</li>
<li>Natural Language is an elective</li>
<li>Pattern Recognition, markov chain/monte carlo is an elective</li>
<li>A lot of good courses in the core courses</li>
<li>Machine Learning for Trading is an elective</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cons:</li>
<li>Overall Thoughts:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Ranking</h2>
<ol>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Computational Perception and Robotics</li>
<li>Computing Systems</li>
<li>Interactive Intelligence</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeah... I'm gonna do Machine Learning.</p>
