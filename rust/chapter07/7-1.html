<h1>Packages and Crates</h1>
<p>A crate is a binary or library. The <em>crate</em> root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from
and makes up the root module of your crate. A <em>package</em> is one or more crates that provide a set of
functionality. A package contains a <code>cargo.toml</code> file that describes how to build those crates.</p>
<p>There are some rules that determine what a package can contain. A package can contain at most one
library. It can contain as many binary crates as you'd library, but it must contain at least one
crate.</p>
<p>To make a new package, we enter the command <code>cargo new packagename</code>. Cargo follows a convention that
<code>src/main.rs</code> is the crate root of a binary crate. Cargo also knows that if the package directory
contains <code>src/lib.rs</code>, the package contains a library crate with the same name as the package and
<code>src/lib.rs</code> is the crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to <code>rustc</code> to build the library or
binary.</p>
<p>If a package only contains <code>src/main.rs</code>, then it only contains a binary crate. If a package
contains <code>src/main.rs</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code>, then it has two crates: A library and a binary, both with
the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary crates by placing files in
<code>src/bin</code>. Each file will be a separate binary crate.</p>
<p>Moving forward we talk about the module system.</p>
